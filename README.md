Mastermind game for Android

The goal of this project was to learn how to use Unity's basic features.
As I mainly focused on functional rather than fancy, there's no custom elements, it uses Unity built-in UI class for images, text etc.
I don't know if it will be updated but any feedback will be appreciated !
